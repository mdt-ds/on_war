    "text": "preface\nWar is a complex issue that deserves respect, especially when war is so close and so raging. But respecting something doesn’t mean you can’t reason about it.\nMaybe it’s exactly the opposite.\nWar in particular seems to require a suspension of human reasoning faculties. You have to be on one side or the other. A third position is not foreseen. When the options are limited, also human reasoning capacity and consequently the ability to find solutions is also limited.\nYet sometimes the best resources and the brightest solutions are found in extreme conditions.\nThe motivation of this essay lies in the need to try to oppose reasoning to the rhetoric of war. And reasoning in this era includes mathematical modeling and computational thinking. These are the two pillars of the current paradigm of science. It’s easy to think of physics and engineering, but economics and finance can be seen as a repackaging of applied mathematics. Surely biology and epidemiology also make extensive use of quantitative methods. Why can’t philosophy of war benefit from a mathematical and computational approach?"

    "text": "thinking about war\nThe need to think about war is evidenced in the history of world religion, philosophy and literature. Below are two outstanding examples in Western and one in Eastern culture.\nCarl Von Clausewitz’s On War (Vom Kriege 1832) is undoubtedly the most influential Western treatise on the subject of war. Von Clausewitz denies that war is a purely military phenomenon and his famous axiom “war is the continuation of politics by other means” has conditioned the thinking of generations of generals and politicians providing the tools to understand the phenomenon of war. For him war is “an act of violence to impose our will on the adversary”. War is “a game of interactions” between uncertainty, friction, randomness. It is an act of political intelligence, calculation of probabilities and willingness to take risks.\nLev Nikolayevich Tolstoy’s novel War and Peace (1829) contains digressions on the philosophy of warfare that directly influenced Gandhi’s Hinduism-centered philosophy of nonviolent resistance. The second epilogue of the novel is then a real essay of critical philosophy of history in which Tolstoy explores the question of the relationship between ‘necessity’ and ‘freedom’ in the historical actions of men. Tolstoy condemns historians who believe that “peoples are led by individuals” and that “there is a certain goal towards which peoples and humanity are moving.”\nTolstoy briefly explains his ethical position saying: “War is so unjust and ugly that those who fight in it have to try to drown out the voice of conscience within themselves.”\nIn Eastern culture, Sun Tzu’s The Art of War (roughly 5th century BC) is the most influential essay. It is an exhaustive treatise about warfare strategies and tactics articulated in 13 chapters: laying plans, waging war, attack by stratagem, tactical disposition, use of energy, weak point and strong, maneuvering an army, variation of tactics, the army on the march, classification of terrain, the nine situations, attack by fire, use of spies.\nAccording to Sun Tzu “The art of war is of vital importance to the State.It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.”"

    "text": "about this essay\nThe reader need not be frightened: in the following few chapters there is nothing so profound and inspiring but also intimidating as Clausewitz treaty or the Tolstoy masterpiece. The reader won’t even find war stories or historical anecdotes.\nThis is a short essay on war that aims to introduce in a concise but clear way some mathematical and computational approaches to the analysis of war. The reader will therefore not find the precision of the mathematical formulation nor the details of the calculation algorithms. Some resources are listed in the boxes exploring further to deepen the mathematical or computational aspects.\nThe intent is to provide the reader with some interpretations and suggest food for thought. As always in the experience of reading an essay, half of the work can be done by the author but the other half must be done by the reader: nothing has value if you don’t strive for it.\n\nThe essay is articulated according to the following mind map.\n\nThe first part, War Trends, applies exploratory data analysis to public data about wars in history and country military spending in contemporary age.\nThe second part, Games of War, analyzes the strategic interactions between enemies through the framework of game theory. Four strategic games are therefore studied: ‘war or peace’; ‘generals deploy their armies’; ‘cold war’ and ‘a rush towards clash’.\nThe third part uses Markov processes to analyze the probabilities related to war with the following models:\n\n\na two states model representing peace / war probabilities for a country;\n\na four states model representing the evolution of war probabilities.\n\nFinally, the fourth part of the essay models both the arms race and the dynamics of a combat using differential equations adapting models from literature: Richardson arms race model and Lanchester combat model.\nAll of the calculations needed for the essay are done with R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics, and its gorgeous ecosystem. Some hints on the R programs developed for this essay are given in the collapsed box computation with R at the end of each chapter. The essay itself is written with Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system."

The relative total casualties are due to the increase in weapon power and the number of countries involved. Dr. Peter Brecke counts six million Jewish victims as an event other than World War II. The massacre of the Jews, also called the Holocaust or Shoah, alone ranks fourth among the bloodiest wars.\nThe Thirty Years’ War, which ranks third, was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history, lasting from 1618 to 1648. Fought mainly in central Europe, it is estimated to have produced between 4.5 and 8 million of soldiers and civilians who died in battles, famine and disease. Some areas of what is now modern Germany experienced population declines of more than 50%.\nThe longest conflicts in history from year 1400 according to the Conflict Catalog are reported in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    name \n    duration \n    start_year \n    end_year \n  \n \n\n  \n    Netherlands-Spain, 1566-1609 \n    43 \n    1566 \n    1609 \n  \n  \n    Siam (revolution), 1647-88 \n    41 \n    1647 \n    1688 \n  \n  \n    Dahomey-tribes, 1818-58 \n    40 \n    1818 \n    1858 \n  \n  \n    China (Qing)-Mongolia (Mongolia), 1594-1632 \n    38 \n    1594 \n    1632 \n  \n  \n    Russia-Crimean Tartars, 1540-72 \n    32 \n    1540 \n    1572 \n  \n  \n    Denmark-Holstein, Hanse towns (from 1426), 1404-35 \n    31 \n    1404 \n    1435 \n  \n  \n    Vietnam (peasant rebellion), 1771-1802 \n    31 \n    1771 \n    1802 \n  \n  \n    England (dynastic, nobles), 1455-85 \n    30 \n    1455 \n    1485 \n  \n  \n    Thirty Years' War, 1618-48 \n    30 \n    1618 \n    1648 \n  \n  \n    United Provinces-Java, 1650-80 \n    30 \n    1650 \n    1680 \n  \n  \n    Sumatra (Malays vs. Padris), 1807-37 \n    30 \n    1807 \n    1837 \n  \n  \n    Ethiopia (Eritrea) (with Cuban intervention), 1961-91 \n    30 \n    1961 \n    1991 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first longest war reported, called Dutch Revolt (Dutch: Nederlandse Opstand), lasted 43 years.

    "text": "1.2 military expenditure\nIn order to validate the claim that all countries in the world spend on their own defense, the SIPRI military spending database was explored.\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, is an independent international institute dedicated to research on conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament and maintains a data set called SIPRI-Milex-data containing information on military spending worldwide over the last years.\nSpecifically, the analysis is focused on the following three datasets:\n\n\nRegional totals, reporting military spending by continental region in billion dollars from 1988 to 2022 at constant 2021 prices and exchange rates, except for the last figure which is reported at 2022 prices and exchange rates;\nConstant (2021) US$, which reports military spending by country in million dollars from 1988 to 2022 at constant 2021 prices and exchange rates;\nShare of Govt. expenditure, reporting military expenditure expressed as a percentage of public administration expenditure.\n\nUsing the second and third dataset, Constant (2021) US$ and Share of Govt. expenditure, the two histograms below show the distribution of national military spending in 2022 both as an absolute value in dollars (on a logarithmic scale) and as a share of total public spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average the military expenditure all over the world according to SIPRI has been of 13949 million dollars and in share of government spending of 6.41%.\nBut interesting things happen at extremes.\nObserving the graph of the distribution of spending in dollars, it can be seen that the values of China, about 298 billion dollars, and the United States, about 811 billion dollars, seem real outliers, values outside the distribution valid for the other countries considering a,lso that the histogram is in log scale. At the other extreme, Costa Rica, Iceland and Panama has no military expenditure reported while Venezuela spent 4.7 million dollars.\nConsidering instead the military expenditures as a ratio of the overall government expenditure, the values that seems not in the same distribution of other countries are related to: Somalia (20.37%), Qatar (23.84%), Saudi Arabia (27.79%) and Belarus (32.12%).\nAt the lower extreme, in 2022 only Haiti, Honduras, Mauritius, Moldova spent less than 1% of the overall government spending.\nExploring the regional totals dataset, it is possible to highlight that in last 20 years the military expenditure has grown all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn just over twenty years, global military spending has grown from about \\(1,200\\) billion dollars to about $2,182 billion dollars. Impressive isn’t it?\nThe region that has spent the most is America led by the United States: its military spending trend stalled in the years around 2010 to decrease slightly until 2016 and then recover from 2017 to 2022. Asia shows a clear constant growth trend of military spending. Europe has maintained consistently high military spending, which appears to be growing fastest in recent years. After an initial period of growth, since around 2015 the Middle East appears to have stabilized its military spending. Africa cannot economically afford a high expense.\nIn order to detect not only for the presence of a growing trend but also for a pattern of arms race, two geopolitical scenarios were analyzed: the major world powers and the Middle East.\nThe arms race pattern is defined as the competitive acquisition of military capabilities between two or more nations although in a broad sense it can be understood as a growing trend.\nThe first analysis concerns some countries among the world powers: China, India, Russia and the United States of America. For each country, military spending from year 2000 to 2022 was traced over time both in absolute value, using Constant (2021) US$ datase, and as a share of government spending using the data from Share of Govt. expenditure dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States spends an incomparable amount of resources on armaments compared to other world powers. As reported in the SIPRI database, US maximum spending was approximately 917 billion dollars in 2010 compared to China’s 298 in 2022, Russia’s 77 in 2016 and India’s 81 in 2022. The US government’s considerable spending on arms does not appear to be a direct reaction to spending by other nations. Instead, it could be a phenomenon due both to the events linked to the consequences of 11 September 2001 and to the weight and importance of the US military apparatus.\nIn the SIPRI data on military spending in relation to total government spending, data from the United States of America is missing, so no clear pattern of arms race can be detected. China’s military spending effort has been declining for the past two decades, India’s appears to be declining slightly while Russia’s effort peaks around 2016. In 2022 Russia spent 10.35% of its global government spending, China 4.79% and India 8.26%.\nThe second analysis concerns some Middle Eastern countries with different political and economic characteristics, namely Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Israel and Lebanon. As for the world powers, the graphs of the trend of military spending from year 2000 to 2022 are presented both in billions of dollars and as a share of overall government spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last twenty years, Saudi Arabia has spent between 22 and 32% of its global spending on armaments, reaching an expenditure of even more than 94 billion dollars in 2015. The military spending high ratio in Saudi Arabia has been possible since the government is a kingdom without relevant economical and political constraint.\nIsrael, which is continually threatened by neighboring countries, has in the last twenty years limited its military expenditure to within 15% of global spending, spending slightly more than 23 billion dollars in 2022. Egypt has steadily decreased its military spending effort starting from about 10% till slightly more than 4% of its overall spending while the spending in dollars remains almost constant reaching 5 billion dollars in 2022.\nIran military spending during last years has from 13 to 17% in 2022. In absolute value last year Iran spent 5,639.7 million dollars. Lebanon growing trend in military expenditure has been cut off in 2019 due to its economic crisis."

Likewise, facts are not history unless they are organized in their context and over time in a way that can be explained.\nIn this sense, the synthetic analysis carried out on historical data is very lacking, but nevertheless allows for some general considerations.\nGiven the differences between the datasets of wars in history analyzed, it is difficult to draw specific conclusions about any historical trends. But it can certainly be said that the history of every region of the world can tell how much destruction and death wars have caused. The twentieth century certainly seems to be the bloodiest among centuries probably for two reasons: the availability of more accurate historical data and the unthinkable growth in the power of weapons.\nThe analysis of the expenditure of modern states on armaments indicates that the possibility of getting involved in war is perceived as real. The amount of arms spending does not appear to follow an arms race pattern in the strict sense in the proposed scenarios, probably due to numerous domestic economic and political constraints. But the global growth in military spending over the past two decades is astounding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomputation with R\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to learn how to explore data with R see Hadley Wickham, Grolemund, and Centinkaya-Rundel (2023).\nFor this chapter the following R packages have been used:\n\n\nrvest by Hadley (rvest) Wickham (2022) for scraping both wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britanica list of wars;\npurrr by Hadley Wickham and Henry (2023) for applying functions to data;\nreadxl by Hadley Wickham and Bryan (2023) for loading into R the Conflict Catalog Data in excel format;\njanitor by Firke (2023) for data cleaning;\ndplyr by Hadley Wickham et al.

    "section": "2.1 war strategy through game theory",
    "text": "2.1 war strategy through game theory\nGame theory is a mathematical theory that tries to make sense of strategic interactions.\nMajor contributions to game theory as a mathematical theory include:\n\n\nJohn Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern 1944 “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” in which a mathematical theory for two-person zero-sum games is presented;\n\nJohn Nash 1950 doctoral thesis “non-cooperative games” discussing a criterion for the mutual consistency of player strategies known as the Nash equilibrium;\n\nthe concept of solving subgame perfect equilibria, which further refined the Nash equilibrium, introduced in 1965 by Reinhard Selten. Selten also introduced the idea of bounded rationality that rationality is bounded when individuals make decisions, and based on these limitations, rational individuals will select a satisfactory decision rather than an optimal one.\n\nGame theory has applications in all fields of the social sciences, as well as strategic decision-making, logic, systems science, and computer science.\nIn game theory, a game is described by four elements:\n\n\nthe players, or opponents as called in this short essay;\n\nthe strategies available to the players;\n\nthe order of moves to be played and\n\nthe payoffs for each different result and player.\n\nOpponents (players in the classic game theory literature) are agents who make rational decisions in the conduct of the game: there are at least two opponents in any game or conflict.\nStrategies are the set of alternative actions that each opponent can take in a game at a particular turn in the case of sequential game.\nMove order can be simultaneous or sequential. In simultaneous play the opponents make their decision at the same time without having any prior knowledge of the opponent’s move. In sequential play, on the other hand, the opponent who moves later knows the strategy adopted in the previous move by his opponents. Ways to solve a game vary depending on the order of movement of the game as the notion of equilibrium is not sufficient to reason about sequential game.\nPayoffs measure each opponent’s preference for the outcome resulting from opponents’ choices. The payoff number therefore indicates how satisfying (positive payoff) or unsatisfactory (negative payoff) a certain outcome of the game would be for a specific player.\nIn the four games (or conflicts) presented below in this section, the following assumptions hold:\n\ngames have a finite number of opponents where each has a finite number of possible courses of action;\neach opponent will always act rationally by choosing the best answer in order to maximize gains and minimize losses for himself;\nthe payoffs are fixed and predetermined.\n\nUnder these hypotheses it is possible to analyze strategic games in order to predict how a game will be played, which strategies will be adopted by the players and the final outcomes and related payoffs. These predictions are called “solutions”.\nSolutions for simultaneous play can be found using one of the following concepts:\n\n\nstrategic (strict) dominance;\n\nbetter response and Nash equilibrium.\n\nStrategic dominance occurs when one player’s strategy yields increasingly better payoffs regardless of the decisions of other opponents. The iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies allows to find an equilibrium solution.\nThe best response is the strategy (or strategies) that produces the most favorable outcome for one player, taking the other players’ strategies for granted. The points by which each opponent in a conflict has selected the best response (or one of the best responses) to the other players’ strategies is called Nash equilibria.\nThe Nash equilibrium could be defined as a profile of strategies (one for each player) such that no single player can obtain a higher payoff by choosing another response to the strategies of other players.\nIn sequential games instead it is necessary to use the concept of perfect subgame equilibrium to find the solution to the given game. A subgame perfect equilibrium represents a Nash equilibrium of each subgame of the original game.\nThis means that at any point in the game, player behavior thereafter should represent a Nash equilibrium of the game, regardless of what happened before. To determine perfect subgame equilibria the methodology called backward induction is applied. Starting at the end of the game and working backwards determines what actions the moving player should take under all possible circumstances to maximize his utility and/or minimize his losses. The set of strategies thus determined are the solution to the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexploring further\n\n\n\nFor an in-depth introduction to game theory, one can refer to Dresher (1961), Drew Fudenberg (1991), Martin J. Osborne (1994), and Tadelis (2013)."

The War or Peace game is a simultaneous game where each opponent makes their move at the same time. The situation depicted in the game is that of two nations targeting each other’s resources or contending for border territory. The opponents are country 1 and country 2 respectively. Each of the opponents can decide whether to wage war or remain in peace. The utility gained if both countries agree to be at peace is zero. If one of the two countries makes war while the other remains at peace, the first country will benefit.

This kind of game specifies the possible orders of events and allows each player to consider his plan of action not only at the beginning of the game but also whenever he has to make a decision. Respecting the historical fact that USA realized and used the nuclear bomb first, the game described in its extensive form by the tree diagram below gives USA the first move. Reverting the order of opponents move nothing change in the meaning of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolved Cold War Game\n\n\n\n\nUSA move first and can decide to attack or not, then USSR can retaliate or not. The preference for USA should be attack with a don’t retaliate response of the Eastern bloc. This USSR response option is clearly not credible. Once nuclear bombed Eastern bloc would surely react. As matter of fact solving this game with backward induction leads to a don’t attack, don’t attack equilibrium.\nThe backwards reasoning is as follows, if the USSR were attacked it would suffer equally whether it retaliated or not, but it is reasonable to assume that it would prefer to see the US equally affected. So the choice would be to fight back. Knowing this, the United States would find it advantageous not to attack.\n\nThe solution of the cold war game is the reason why you, the reader, and the author too, can wake up tomorrow morning.\nWith regard to the historical events related to the cold war, it is also interesting to remember how Ronald Reagan and Michail Gorbachev facilitated the easing of tensions between the two blocs at the end of the cold war. They did it one small step after another. Each deal required the elimination of a few nuclear weapons at a time by both sides.\nWhat you can’t do in one go, maybe you can achieve step by step."

The game situation is that of two countries in open conflict that can decide to escalate or to concede. Both countries have weapons of mass destruction, so if both decide to step up the outcome will be something neither would prefer (payoffs -100, -100). If both countries withdraw they will gain nothing, they will remain at the status quo (payoffs 0, 0).

These are called pure strategies. In this game of escalation, however, an opponent may want to randomly choose between several courses of action. If an opponent randomly chooses which strategy to play, we say that the opponent is using a “mixed strategy” instead of a pure strategy. In a pure strategy an opponent definitely chooses an action, while in a mixed strategy he chooses a probability distribution on all the actions at his disposal.\nA mixed strategy for an opponent is exactly a probability distribution over his set of available actions. At a mixed strategy Nash equilibriun, each opponent is indifferent between each of their pure strategy.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmixed strategy NE\n\n  \n    strategy \n    country1 \n    country2 \n  \n \n\n  \n    escalate \n    0.05 \n    0.05 \n  \n  \n    concede \n    0.95 \n    0.95 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe surprising result is that both opponents find a 5% probability of war escalation reasonable in a randomized hypothesis. In other words, there is a 5% chance of destroying our world which is thought to be reasonable."

    "section": "3.1 markov chains",
    "text": "3.1 markov chains\nA Markov process is a stochastic process in which:\n\nthe set of possible states is finite;\nthe transition probability in a state depends only on the present state: this is the so-called Markov property which states that “the future is independent from the past given the present”;\nthe transition probabilities are constant over time.\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, Markov chain theory is a clever combination of probability theory and linear algebra that is used to model a real-world system that is in discrete states, but it is not entirely clear how has evolved.\nThus the real-world system is modeled as a sequence of states that over time moves between states with a specific probability. Since the states are connected to each other, they form a chain.\nMarkov chains are used in a variety of situations because they can be designed to model many real-world processes. These areas range from animal population mapping to search engine algorithms, music composition and speech recognition.\nMarkov chains are exhaustively defined by a set of states and a transition probability matrix between them. If the Markov chain has \\(n\\) possible states, the matrix will be a square matrix \\(n \\cdot n\\), such that the element \\((i, j)\\) is the transition probability from state \\(i\\) to state \\(j\\).\nAlso, the transition matrix must be a stochastic matrix, one whose entries in each row must sum to exactly 1. Similarly if the Markov chain is represented by drawing a transition state diagram, the probabilities of the transition arrows coming out from a node, or state, add up to one.\nTo initialize a Markov chain an initial state vector \\(n \\cdot 1\\) is defined in order to describe the starting probability distribution for each of the possible \\(n\\) states. The \\(i\\) entry of the vector describes the probability that the chain starts at state \\(i\\).\nTo obtain the multi-step transition probability, the one-step transition matrix is multiplied by itself by the number of necessary transitions. In other words, the transition probability of arriving at state \\(j\\) from state \\(i\\) after \\(n\\) steps is indicated by the position \\(i,j\\) of the transition matrix to the nth power.\nThe stationary distribution represents the distribution of states for a long-term Markov process i.e. as the number of steps or transitions increases. A stationary distribution of a Markov chain is a probability distribution that remains unchanged after some transition period. Typically, it is represented as a row vector \\(π\\) whose entries are probabilities that add to 1, and given the transition matrix \\(P\\), it satisfies \\(π=π \\cdot P\\). The stationary distribution provides information on the stability of the random process and, in some cases, describes the limiting behavior of the Markov chain.\nAndrey Markov, the Russian mathematician who first studied this type of stochastic process, was able to prove that, as long as all states in the chain can be reached (irreducibility), the probability to be in a particular state will converge to a single constant value in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexploring further\n\n\n\nFor an in-depth introduction to markov chains and stochastic processes, one can refer to Tijms (2003), Kulkarni (2009) and Pinsky and Karlin (2011)."

    "text": "3.2 will there be war?\nA nation can enjoy a long period of peace or face war depending on many factors including its geopolitical position, its alliances and the presence on its territory of goods of interest to other countries. It has been seen in history that the transition from peace to war can be triggered by a sudden and uncontrollable conflict or have deep roots, while the transition from war to peace is usually long and difficult but there is always an opportunity for peace as well.\n\n3.2.1 markov chain model\nThis real world situation can be modeled with a markov chain process with only two states:\n\npeace, in this state the modeled nation is in peace with other countries;\nwar, on the contrary in this state nation is fighting with other countries.\n\n\n\n\nThe hypothetical nation, if in a peaceful state, can remain in peace or can go to war and while in war can keep on fighting or make peace. The state transition diagram representing the markov chain model is displayed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a Markov chain in which every state can be reached from every other state is said to be strongly connected or irreducible, and such a structure is the condition for the existence of a unique stationary distribution.\nTo complete the Markov chain model it is necessary to define the transition probability matrix. Two different situations are considered:\n\n\na peaceful nation;\n\na nation at risk of war.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 a peaceful nation\nSuppose the hypothetical nation is in a peaceful area where neighboring nations are also peaceful, it has good international relations with every country and no history of recent conflicts. In such a situation the probability of remaining in a peaceful state could be 0.98, and then going to war could be only 0.02. In war the probability of continuing to fight could be 0.65 and then achieving peace the probability should go up to 0.35. Note that the transition probabilities have been assigned completely arbitrarily for demonstration purpose only. The probability transition matrix below describes this model.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto\n\n  \n      \n    peace \n    war \n  \n \n\n  from\n\n    peace \n    0.98 \n    0.02 \n  \n  \n    war \n    0.35 \n    0.65 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nStarting from a peace state, initial state vector with probability 1 of peace and probability 0 of war, the chances will evolve following the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case probabilities to enter war increase very slightly reaching the stationary distribution represented as in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    peace \n    war \n  \n \n\n  \n    steady state probabilities \n    0.9459459 \n    0.0540541 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nA hypothetical peaceful nation maintains high probabilities of being at peace within a strongly connected two-state Markov chain model. Yet over time the probability of being in a peaceful state has decreased somewhat.\n\n\n3.2.3 a nation at risk of war\nThe model presented in this section assumes that the hypothetical nation is in a turbulent area where some neighboring nations are at war, it has a difficult international relationship with some neighboring countries and a history of recent conflicts. In such a situation the probability of remaining in a peaceful state could be 0.74, and therefore the probability of going to war could be 0.26, In war the probability of continuing to fight could be 0.85 and therefore the probability of achieving peace should be 0.15. Note that, also in this case, the transition probabilities have been assigned completely arbitrarily for demonstration purpose only. The probability transition matrix below describes this model.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto\n\n  \n      \n    peace \n    war \n  \n \n\n  from\n\n    peace \n    0.74 \n    0.26 \n  \n  \n    war \n    0.15 \n    0.85 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nStarting from a peace state the probabilities will evolve following the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter only three time steps, say years, the hypothetical nation would have same probability to find itself in war or in peace.

    "text": "3.3 will there be peace again?\nIn this section, war itself and its possible states in the course of its evolution are modeled.\nIn a certain period war can be harsh and require a high cost in terms of human lives, civilians and soldiers, and of military and economic resources. Later the situation can become even more difficult both because the war can be extended to other countries and because unconventional weapons can be used. It is possible, on the contrary, that the war enters a state of greater calm in which the fighting subsides. This de-escalation phase can then eventually lead to the initiation of peace talks between enemies and the establishment of truces on battlefronts.\n\n3.3.1 markov chain model\nThis war evolution can be modeled as a markov chain with only four states:\n\nwar escalation meaning more arms, more battles, more destruction and casualties;\nwar de-escalation meaning, on the contrary, no new arms, less battles, less destruction and casualties;\ntruce means truce on battlefronts, peace talks and possibly a ceasefire agreement;\nwar expansion meaning that other nations enters directly in fights leading to a potential regional or world war and / or that opponents starts using non conventional weapons including chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.\n\nThe war can evolve in almost any direction excluding going:\n\n\nfrom war escalation state directly to a truce phase;\n\nfrom war de escalation state directly to war expansion;\n\nfrom war expansion state directly to a truce phase; \nfrom truce state directly to war expansion.\n\nHowever, the chain remains irreducible since from any state it is possible to reach any other state even if not necessarily in one step.\nThe following state transition diagram fully describes the Markov chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 a war evolving situation\nThe situation to be modeled relates to a war in a turbulent region where the enemies have strong alliances. and are determined to achieve their goals through warfare. In this condition the transition probabilities could be represented by the following transition probability matrix.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto\n\n  \n      \n    escalation \n    de-escalation \n    truce \n    expansion \n  \n \n\n  from\n\n    escalation \n    0.90 \n    0.05 \n    0.0 \n    0.05 \n  \n  \n    de-escalation \n    0.25 \n    0.65 \n    0.1 \n    0.00 \n  \n  \n    truce \n    0.05 \n    0.25 \n    0.7 \n    0.00 \n  \n  \n    expansion \n    0.08 \n    0.02 \n    0.0 \n    0.90 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the war is in a state of escalation, it has a 0.90 chance of remaining in this state and only a 0.05 chance of reducing or expanding the war. On the other hand, there is no possibility of entering a state of truce. If the war is in a state of escalation, the odds are 0.65 of remaining in this state, 0.25 of entering a state of escalation of war, and 0.10 of initiating a state of truce. Starting from a state of truce it is not possible to move to a war expansion while the probability of remaining in a truce is 0.70, the probability of entering a state of de-escalation is 0.25 and of moving to a state of escalation is 0.05. If the war is expanding, it cannot go into truce but escalate with probability 0.08 or de-escalate with probability 0.02. Note that, as with previous models, the transition probabilities have been assigned completely arbitrarily for demonstration purposes only.\nThe following graph shows the probabilities evolution computed with linear algebra.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 25 steps, say months, war probabilities are very stable and near the stationary distribution represented as in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    escalation \n    de-escalation \n    truce \n    expansion \n  \n \n\n  \n    steady state probabilities \n    0.56 \n    0.12 \n    0.04 \n    0.28 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the long run given the constant probability transition matrix for the modeled situation, be in a war escalation state has still the greater probability. The second probable state is war expansion. Truce reach no more than 0.05 probability."

    "text": "4.1 dynamical system\nA dynamical system is a model describing the temporal evolution of a system, it is a mean of describing how one state develops into another state over the course of time.\nAs this chapter proceeds, dynamic models will be represented both in their mathematical form as systems of differential equations and as stock and flow diagrams.\nThe mathematical definition of a dynamical system is as follow: \\[\\frac{d}{dt}x = f(x,t,u;\\beta)\\] where:\n\nx, called state vector, contains the minimum set of variables needed to describe the system under study;\nf, the dynamics, is a set of functions each one representing the derivative with respect to time of the corresponding state variable in the state vector;\nu, control or actuation, are variables influencing the state of the system that one have control over;\n\\(\\beta\\), are a set of parameters for which the analysis is useful.\n\nThe proceeding of this chapter considers only linear systems, in the state variables, and autonomous ones, i.e. in which time \\(t\\) is not present in the dynamics.\nThe solution of a dynamical system is a set function of time for each state variable: \\(x(t)\\).\nIn order to formulate a dynamical system, the use of the diagram is very helpful to clarify the structure of the system and to formalize the equations that rule the evolution over time.\nThe diagramming methodology of stocks and flow is used for this purpose in the chapter proceedings. Note that the graphic symbols differ from those reported in the literature.\nThese diagrams consist of:\n\n\nstate (or stock) variables, displayed as rectangles;\n\nflow variables, displayed as thick arrows with a circle in the middle;\n\ncontrol (or auxiliary) variables, displayed with no symbol;\n\nparameters and constants, with no symbol;\n\ncausal links between variables, displayed as thin arrows;\n\nsource and sink, displayed with oval, representing the boundary of the modeled system.\n\nEach stock is thought of as the accumulation of each state variable in the system. It is thus said that the system has memory (or history).\nThere are two types of flows: inflows and outflows. Inflows are perceived as the rate at which the state variable (the flow is going to) is increasing over time. Similarly, the outflow is the rate at which the stock (the flow is going out from) is decreasing.\nState and flow variables differ in their units of measurement. A stock is measured at one specific time, and represents a quantity existing at that point in time, which may have accumulated in the past. A flow variable is measured over an interval of time. Therefore, a flow would be measured per unit of time. Flow is roughly analogous to rate or speed in this sense.\nState variables can only change due to flows into and out of them. The net flow is eventually the outflow subtracted from the inflow.\nIn other words the net flow is therefore the derivative of the state variable with respect to time. \\[\\frac{d\\ state\\_variable}{dt} = inflow(t) - outflow(t)\\]\nIt is now easy to understand that a state variable is the integral, the inverse operation of the derivative, of the net flow added to the initial value of the state variable or stock.\n\\[state\\_variable(t) = \\int_{t_0}^t [inflow(s) - outflow(s)] ds + state\\_variable(t_0)\\]\nAll said can be condensed in this simple stocks & flows diagram.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: netflow\n\n\nThe solution methods of a dynamical system are not in the scope of this short essay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexploring further\n\n\n\nFor an in-depth introduction to differential equations, one can refer to Boyce, Diprima, and Meade (2017).

    "section": "4.2 arms race model",
    "text": "4.2 arms race model\nIn the context of this section, the arms race is defined as a competition between two nations or alliances for military superiority through the development of new and more powerful weapons and the strengthening of armed forces.\nA causal arms race model was originally developed by Lewis Fry Richardson after serving for the French medical corps in World War I. His model considers three main causes for which nations increase or decrease their armaments.\nThe three hypothesized causal relationships included in the model adapted for this essay are:\n\n\na nation makes changes to its own levels of arms spending proportional to that of the competing nation out of fear of military insecurity;\n\narms spending is limited by the country’s overall economy and also by its political system. This constraint is proportional to the size of one’s current military spending;\n\nhostilities, ambitions, and grievances drive nations to arm at a constant rate also independently from direct military threat from another nation.\n\nThe following stock and flow diagram shows graphically the model definition. The thick arrows represents the flows. Each thin arrow show a causal relationship.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: arms race stock & flow\n\n\nThe state variables or stocks, displayed as rectangles, represent the military spending of both nations in the competing arms race.\nThe system boundaries, shown as ovals, represent where spending power comes from, the sources, and where military spending savings, the sinks, are allocated. In the specific case, therefore, the model foresees interactions both in input and in output only with the global expenditure of each nation.\nThe inflow rate for both nations is governed by:\n\n\na positive factor proportional to the arms expenditure of the competing nation representing the fear response to a increased military power of a competing nation;\n\na positive constant factor that indicates the nation hostility and grievance towards other countries.\n\nThe outflow rate for both nations is governed by:\n\n\na negative factor proportional to its own expenditure representing the internal economical and political constraints.\n\n\nFrom the stock and flow diagram is relatively easy to write the differential equations that rule the arms race phenomenon structured as per the model diagram assuming that each causal effect is additive.\n\\[ \\frac{d\\_milexA}{dt} = fa \\cdot milexB - la \\cdot milexA + ga \\]\n\\[ \\frac{d\\_milexB}{dt} = fb \\cdot milexA - lb \\cdot milexB + gb \\]\nThe instantaneous rate of change of each nation’s military expenditures is given by:\n\n\na positive factor proportional to the dimension of the competing nation’s military expenditure. Whose proportionality constant \\(fa\\) or \\(fb\\) represents the nation’s fear of its opponent;\n\na negative factor proportional to one’s own expenditures with the constant \\(la\\) or \\(lb\\) indicating the limiting strength of the internal conditions in the country;\n\na constant positive rate \\(ga\\) or \\(gb\\) which represents the resentment and belligerence present in the nation itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to explain the behavior of the arms race phenomenon, four scenarios have been considered:\n\n\nboth nations react out of fear to the other nation’s arming effort;\n\nboth nations have strong economical and/or internal politics restrains;\n\none nation is hostile towards the other that reacts out of fear;\n\nonly one nation is subject to strong internal constraints.\n\nIn the table below the model parameters for each scenario are displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameter\nboth react by fear\nboth economical restrains\nhostility balanced by fear reaction\none nations with economical restrains\n\n\n\n\nreaction by fear A\n4.5\n1.5\n1.5\n2.0\n\n\nrestrain A\n1.5\n3.5\n1.0\n1.5\n\n\ngrievance A\n0.5\n0.5\n5.5\n0.5\n\n\nreaction by fear B\n3.5\n2.5\n4.5\n2.5\n\n\nrestrain B\n1.0\n4.5\n1.5\n4.5\n\n\ngrievance B\n0.5\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n\n\n\nTo explain the behavior of the arms race phenomenon in each scenario, this chapter proceeds to a phase plane analysis.\nThe phase plane is a graph that allows an analysis of the infinite solutions of a dynamic system by representing on the plane of the state variables, \\(milexA\\) and \\(milexB\\), both the vector field, i.e. the derivatives at each point of the plane, and each nullcline, the line for which the derivative of a state variable with respect to time is 0.\nSpecifically the arrows of the vector field indicate the direction in which the system evolve over time. A specific path of the system defined by the state variables and governed by the specified dynamics that follows the vector field from a specific starting point in the phase plane is called a trajectory. A trajectory is a specific solution of the dynamical system given a initial condition: an initial state of the system.\nTo facilitate the visualization, some significant trajectories relating to different initial conditions are plotted in the phase plane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first quadrant phase plane, top left, represents a situation where both nations react strongly by fear but have no significant economic restrictions or hostility toward the other nation. The vector field shows that:\n\nin the region where military expenditure for nation B is higher than one of nation A the arrows point towards an increase of military expenditure for nation A, from left to right;\nin the region where military expenditure for nation A is higher than one of nation B the arrows point towards an increase of military expenditure for nation B, from bottom up;\nin the region where military expenditure for nation B and nation A are comparable the arrows point towards an increase of both military expenditure, towards upper right of the plane.\n\nThe arms race in this case leads each nation to a continuous growth of its military expenditures. Regardless of where each nation started in the long run they will have a high similar amount of expenses in military defense.\nThe phase plane in the upper right quadrant instead refers to a situation where both nations are in dire economic straits. In this scenario the vector field arrows bend towards the lower left corner of the phase plane, towards both nations’ military spending reduction. Thus, in the long run, both nations will end up with zero military spending.\nThe phase plane in the lower left quadrant is very similar to that in the upper left but is produced by different causes. In this scenario, nation A’s resentment of nation B is balanced by nation B’s fearful reaction of armed conflict. For this reason the arrows of the vector field in the region with higher expenditure for A goes form bottom to top while in the region with higher expenditure for B bend slightly down but then goes up. Since the reaction out of fear has a growth proportional to the spending of the competing nation while that out of resentment is a constant growth, the evolution of military spending over time will lead nation B to spend more than nation A.\nThe last phase plane, bottom right, shows that in case of only one nation has significant economic restriction in the long run the the military expenditure of both nations will be reduced. The vector field is similar to that in the graph directly above but the upper region where the arrows are directed from top left to bottom right is much larger. Also notice how the area where the arrows point directly at zero narrows. Since country B has more restrictions, its decline in military spending is faster and sharper where country A’s spending is slightly higher.\nThe analysis of the model performed in the time domain for some specific initial spending is displayed in the following four graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top left graph shows the exponential growth of each nation’s military spending when fear response is the primary factor for each nation. This tendency is due to the fact that in this case the predominant cause is the fear reaction of a possible armed conflict which has an effect proportional to the level of expenditure of the opposing nation.\nThe graph at the top right instead shows the exponential decay of each nation’s military expenditures due to strong internal constraints. Since the effect is proportional to the expenditure level by each nation, the nation with the least level of expenditures at an early stage shows an armaments growth due to the contribution of the other two causes identified by the model: the fear reaction and preconceived hostility.\nThe graph on the bottom left instead shows the growth of military expenditures determined by a nation that is strongly hostile but which does not let itself be guided by fear which is opposed by a nation guided by a reaction of fear towards the possible armed conflict. Since the hostility effect modeled is one of steady growth, in the long run the nation reacting primarily out of fear, an effect modeled as proportional to the enemy nation’s spending, will spend more on armaments.\nThe bottom right last graph shows that the restrictions imposed by the economy on a single nation contribute to a slow dynamic of expenditures decrease under conditions of low hostility and normal reaction out of fear of the opposing nation. In the long run the nation with a stronger economy will lead the race without incurring a huge expense."

    "text": "4.3 combat model\nThe Lanchester combat model points to the strength of armies as the root cause of the outcome of a battle or war.\nLosses in an army for this model are due:\n\n\nmainly to the effectiveness, due to preparation, armament and equipment, and to numeric consistency of the enemy army;\n\nbut also to the operational conditions of the conflict, including army morale which may facilitate desertions and unenforced surrenders and logistics capabilities which may also lead to casualties from disease and excessive fatigue.\n\nLater in the presentation of the model, as a further element affecting the result of the combat, the possibility of receiving reinforcements from military reserves was taken into consideration.\nThe following stock and flow diagram is a schematic representation of the combat model freely adapted for this essay. The diagram maps each causal hypothesis above into specific symbols.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: combat model stock & flow\n\n\nThe two stocks, displayed as rectangles, represent the consistency or rather the strengths of the opposing armies.\nThe boundaries to the model, represented as ovals, are in input the reserve military strength of each army, i.e. the source of reinforcements, and in output the losses suffered by each army, the sink.\nThe outflow for each army is governed by a loss rate composed of a factor proportional to the size of the enemy army and a factor proportional to the size of one’s own army.\nThe proportionality parameter for the first factor indicates the combat effectiveness of the enemy army and includes considerations such as equipment, weapons and training. The higher this parameter, the more losses one army can inflict on the other.\nThe proportionality parameter for the second factor indicates the operational condition of the army and includes considerations such as morale, logistics, supply. The lower this parameter, the better the operating conditions of the army at the front, the less losses the army itself will suffer from operational causes.\nThe inflow is an input function of time representing the possibility of having reinforcements.\nThe following differential equations are the translation in mathematics of the stock and flow diagram above.\n\\[ \\frac{d\\ armyA}{dt} = + Areinforce(t) - Befficacy \\cdot armyB -Aops \\cdot armyA\\] \\[ \\frac{d\\ armyB}{dt} = + Breinforce(t) - Aefficacy \\cdot armyA -Bops \\cdot armyB\\]\nThe instantaneous rate of change of an army with respect to time is given by:\n\n\na function over time representing the arrival of reinforcements, with the plus sign as it is the inflow;\n\nthe factor representing the losses inflicted by the enemy, with a minus sign as it is a component of the rate of outflow;\n\nthe factor representing the losses due to operational reasons, also in the outflow rate.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to better understand the combat model, two different situations has been simulated. The situation called army B strongest simulates army B is better equipped and trained and it is subject to minor operational loss not considering its initial consistency. The situation called army A strongest on the contrary foresees army A with stronger parameters.\nIn the table below the model parameters for each situation are displayed.\n\n\n\nparameter\narmy B strongest\narmy A strongest\n\n\n\n\nB efficacy\n0.05\n0.03\n\n\nA operational conditions\n0.001\n0.0008\n\n\nA effecacy\n0.025\n0.05\n\n\nB operational conditions\n0.0007\n0.002\n\n\n\nInitially the two models have been studied without the possibility of having reinforcement, without the inflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phase plane graphs of the two scenarios show how the trajectory of the war progress strongly depends on the initial army levels. When Army B is better trained, equipped, and determined, Army A can only defeat the enemy if the initial army size is larger. The same is true in reversed positions when Army A is better equipped, trained, and determined. In fact, in the first case, in the left phase plane, the area of the vector field where the arrows point to the left, towards the zeroing of Army A’s strength, is greater, while in the right phase plane, the area where the arrows point down, towards Army B’s strength at zero, is greater.\nIn the time domain the two models analyzed in the phase plane have been solved for specific initial conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first scenario with Army B better equipped and prepared, the initial level of Army A is fixed at 1200 units while Army B has 1000 units. In 35 time units, days or hours depending on the analysis setting, Army A is wiped out despite starting with 200 more units because a better equipped, better prepared and more determined army can overcome a larger army.\nThe second scenario instead shows that the numerical strength of the army defines the outcome of the war when the numerical gap of the army is too significant. Army A has 900 units while Army B has 1200 units. The difference in preparation, equipment and determination does not compensate for the gap in strength. Thus the overall level of Army B remains higher than Army B.\nFinally, the inflow part of the model, the arrival of reinforcements, is added not as a continuous function of time but, for simplicity, as discrete events at certain specific times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first scenario, army B strongest and same initial conditions as in above model, the reinforcements for army A arrive in 5 consecutive times, from time 23, for a total of 340 units. But the mobilization of the reserves does not change the final outcome even if for a certain moment the forces in the field are again in favor of Army A.\nIn the second scenario, army A strongest and same initial consistency of the armies, the arrival of reinforcements for army A is concentrated in one moment, time 18, with 300 more units. In this case, being Army A better equipped, better trained and more determined, the arrival of reinforcements reverses the outcome of the war by changing the proportion of forces in the field."

    "section": "5.2 a bit of controversy",
    "text": "5.2 a bit of controversy\nMathematics is a very powerful language and it is universal. Mathematics can be used to describe and reveal new trends, to analyze and predict the evolution of real-life phenomena, to explain and simulate the course of events. This is true, as has been demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs of this short essay, even in matters of war.\nMathematical models provide structure and formalization to theory and reasoning thus responding to Forrester’s strong epistemological objection: “without an organizational structure, knowledge is a mere collection of conflicting observations, practices and incidents” (System Dynamics Society 2017).\nFurthermore, mathematical models are humble and honest things that state about themselves the assumptions under which they are valid and their limitations.\nBut in the hands of those untrained in mathematical modeling, the risk of misunderstandings is very high. One can extrapolate conclusions into domains where the model is not valid, or one can conclude something without testing the assumptions of the model.\nPlato, in the seventh chapter of the Republic, states that the warrior needs “to know calculations and numbers if he wants to understand anything about tactics”. And shortly afterwards he argues that “it would be better to impose this discipline by law and to persuade those who have to exercise the highest offices in the city to orient themselves towards the science of calculation and to study it not superficially, but until reaching the contemplation of the nature of numbers with a pure intellect , without using it to sell and buy, as merchants and shopkeepers do, but for war and to facilitate the conversion of the soul itself from becoming to truth and being”.\nFrom a quick web search, Plato’s pointers were overlooked as the leaders of the world’s most powerful nations have little to no math curriculum.\nYet those who make such dramatic decisions as those relating to weapons and war should be able to understand the mathematical models that analysts propose to facilitate decision-making based on data and numerical considerations.\nIt could be argued that the leaders of nations rely on qualified advisers to make strategic decisions. But this would be to say that decisions are made on the basis of considerations that cannot be fully understood by the decision-makers.\nIn a democratic context, even those who practice the profession of journalist should be able to ask political leaders and explain to citizens salient points related to the war such as:\n\n\nwhat strategic game is the government playing?\n\nwhat is the probabilistic model within which the government takes its decisions?\n\nwhat are the expected outcomes of a war given the ratio of military forces?\n\nAnd the citizen cannot let himself be overwhelmed by the quantity of news, often incomplete, and comments, which express a single point of view since the others are not available during the war, without that organization of information and context which serve to form awareness."

As in Tolstoy’s quote introducing these conclusions, “on war” would also be an invitation to everyone to fight for their convictions or at least to form their own rational framework that allows them to think about war."
